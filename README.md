# Galaxy-Disc-Fitting
These scripts were used for creating and fitting galaxy disc profiles to semi-resolved high-redshift sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), for a paper in progress.

You may find detailed descriptions for each script with the code.

In general, these scripts:
- use GalPak-3D to fit disc models to galaxies in order to provide insight to their intrinsic properties (http://galpak.irap.omp.eu/);
- help visualize the differences between each model with multi-panel figures
- provide position-velocity (PV) diagrams and compare these real data to the modelled discs.

The code is specified for my data set, but may easily be changed for any set of extragalactic resolved or semi-resolved galaxies!
